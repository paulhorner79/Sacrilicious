ABOUT 

Sacrilicious was developed at the OER Hackdays, Manchester 2011.
http://wiki.cetis.ac.uk/OER_Hack_Days

This work was designed to provide a bookmarking service specifically relating to Open Educational Resources.  It's called sacrilicious because it's a bit like delicious - mmm sacrilicious - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUnH9NECSUU

The following functionality is available - 

1. Bookmarklet that adds a bookmark to the database - picks up rel="license" from <a> tags, publisher and author from <meta> tags and the title from the page <title>
2. Authentication is currently only through Twitter.  Which admittedly is a bit odd, but it worked for us on the day
3. Tagging uses Django-tagging.  You can browse by tags.  It could do with having something that auto-populates tags.
4. Comments through Django-Disqus.

It's a good start given the time we had, but it needs further development
